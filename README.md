# web_messenger2
This project is just an elevated version of the previous messenger, mainly I will make separate chats, and add the online/offline status, also definetly work on the design. I decided to use node js instead because it is much easier to learn. Aditionally, here I will absolutely need somesort of database, although I haven't decided on which to choose yet. I will definetly have to lock in on coming up weekends.
