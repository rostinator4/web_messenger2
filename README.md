# web_messenger2
This project is just elevated version of the previous project, mainly i will make separate chats, and add the online/offline status. I decided to use node js instead because it is much easier in learning. Aditionally here i will definetly need somesort of database, I haven't decided on which to choose yet. I will definetly have to lock in.
